Fyrox is an [open-source](https://github.com/FyroxEngine/Fyrox) Rust game engine with lots of out-of-box 
game-ready features and a full-featured editor. Changes of this week were mostly focuses on UI style
and usability improvements. 

## Editor Restyling

The editor now has more cleaner and modern user interface:

The old version for comparison:

The new style does not have radical differences with the previous one - it just improves existing style,
to make it a bit more attractive.

## Ability to Search Assets

Asset browser is now able to search assets by name:

## Book Improvements

The book is now have two new sections - [Audio Bus](https://fyrox-book.github.io/fyrox/sound/bus.html) and 
[HRTF](https://fyrox-book.github.io/fyrox/sound/hrtf.html).

## Other

Imported animations are now enabled by default, previously they were imported as disabled which could lead
to confusions. UI's `DrawingContext` is now able to draw arcs and rounded rectangles.

Experimental Android support should be ready at the next week.
