The engine was renamed from **rg3d** to **Fyrox**. There are multiple reasons for that:

- rg3d is hard to pronounce.
- It has `3d` in it, which has become confusing after adding proper 2D support.
- It is not memorable - some random letters and numbers.

The new name is not ideal too, but it is somewhat memorable, easy to pronounce, and less confusing.

## Meaning and origin

So what does the new name mean and how it was created? Originally I proposed `Feox` as a new name, but a lot
of people from the community told me that is sound like it missing `r` letter, so I added it, and it became
`Ferox`. As with any good name it was already taken, and I decided to change a single letter and the `Fyrox` 
was born.

After this somebody noticed, that the name is actually sounds like `Fire` + `Ox`, and `BillyDM` created the 
logo with the "flaming bull". This is an excellent example of community work!
