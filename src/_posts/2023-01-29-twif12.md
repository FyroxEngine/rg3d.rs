Fyrox is an [open-source](https://github.com/FyroxEngine/Fyrox) Rust game engine with lots of out-of-box 
game-ready features and a full-featured editor. This week was mostly dedicated to adding some new features 
and fixing existing functionality.

## Ability to Animate Material Properties

It is now possible to animate properties of any material, it adds a lot of control for various visual 
effects that use custom shaders. Animation editor is now able to bind to material properties, making 
something like this possible:

![material animation](/assets/twif12/material_animation.gif)

This can be applied to pretty much any numeric shader uniform, which adds an ability to create any kinds
of visual effects.

## Reflection Improvements

Reflection now supports hash maps. This functionality was added to have an ability to animate properties 
of materials via engine's animation system (see the gif above). This was a pretty easy change, but it 
added more flexibility to the reflection system. The next improvement will be an ability to clone 
`dyn Reflect` values to add an ability to copy-paste properties in the Inspector.

## Audio Improvements in the Editor

Sound management in the editor now much more predictable and convenient. Previously, any sound in Playing
state would immediately start playing after you load a scene in the editor, making pretty much impossible 
to create sound effects. It is now fixed, every sound is now not updating until you start previewing it.
This can be done in a new audio preview panel:

![audio preview panel](/assets/twif12/audio.png).

To activate it, all you need to do is to select a Sound node. Then you need to click on `Preview` checkbox
and the sound will start playing. Any changes made in this panel will not be recorded in the scene, you 
can play with the sound as you want to.

## Automatic Resource Handle Restoration

When the engine saves a scene that has resource handles, those handles saves only path to resources, not
the actual content. When loading the same scene, the engine re-loads all resources, but all handles scattered
around must be restored manually to point to actual resource data. This is now fixed, the engine will use 
reflection to iterate over each field of every scene node and restore the handles.

## Other

Fixed terrain editing in the editor; its material property is now exposed in the Inspector. Terrains geometry
is now update immediately when doing changes to the height map. 

It is now possible to fetch standard shader names. Sound nodes now have validation, which check if a sound source
has missing sound buffer.

It is now possible to force the engine to create unique materials when instantiating a prefab.

## Full List of Changes in Random Order
