I'm happy to announce that rg3d 0.20 has been released. This release contains a lot of new features and improvements.
The most large are **WebAssembly support**, initial **2D support** and **multi-layer terrains**.

Let's start from the engine, there are 182 new commits compared to 0.19 and here's the most interesting changes:

## rg3d

- WebAssembly support - [check this online demo](https://rg3d.rs/assets/webexample/index.html)
- Initial 2D support - with lighting and physics (check it by `cargo run --example 2d --release`)
- Multi-layer terrains - now you can create outdoor scenes as you would in many other game engines - 
  check example by `cargo run --example terrain --release`
- Added `Framework` which hides engine initialization and a game loop, all you need to do to start
  writing your game is to implement `GameState` trait for your game structure - 
  [here](https://github.com/FyroxEngine/Fyrox/blob/master/examples/framework.rs) is the minimal
  example. Some examples have been refactored to use Framework, so can be used as a guide.
- Changed a way of setting shader uniforms - now it uses closure instead of set of enum variants which is a lot
  faster.
- Added `Save` mode for FileSelector and FileBrowser widgets - no need to type file name manually at the end of the 
  path text box - there is separate "File name" field for that.
- Immediately load requested textures to GPU to prevent huge lag on first frame.
- Changed selection behaviour for TreeWidget.
- Refactored examples - now they should be more clear.
- Added continuous integration (huge thanks to [Gideon Grinberg](https://github.com/gideongrinberg) and [Voodlaz](https://github.com/Voodlaz))
- Support for custom vertex formats.
- Ray-terrain intersection test.
- Ability to pause sound context.
- TextBox widget now can be in read-only state.
- Fixed procedural textures serialization.
- Added serialization support for arrays.
- Fixed instanced rendering.
- Fixed Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion banding issues.
- Fixed light scattering issues.
- Smart cascade selection for shadow maps.
- Added proc-macro for Visit trait (huge thanks to [toyboot4e](https://github.com/toyboot4e))
- Fixed lighting issues.
- Added scroll options for ScrollViewerBuilder.
- Default shadows precision is now Full instead of Half which could cause graphical artifacts.
- Fixed critical physics [serialization bug](https://github.com/FyroxEngine/Fyrox/commit/82e52a5e39747f85fe7819215765a9a0bcddf1bc).
- Added "on-demand" texture compression via [tbc](https://github.com/mrDIMAS/tbc) crate which supports R8RGTC, 
  RG8RGTC, DXT1, DXT3, DXT5 compression.
- Improved renderer performance.
- Built-in profiler now able to print result in a string.
- Added parallax mapping.
- Improved performance of UI layout and message routing.
- Added tooltips and context menus (huge thanks to [MinusGix](https://github.com/MinusGix)).
- Ambient lighting belongs to scene, not renderer as it was before.
- Multiple expansion strategies for Tree widget.
- Fixed selection in ListView.
- Added first overview of engine's architecture - it should help newcomers to be able to easily start contributing.
- Minor fixes and improvements.

## [rusty-editor](https://github.com/mrDIMAS/rusty-editor)

rusty-editor has gain lots of improvements for last few months. One of the huge improvements is the terrain
editor. Check this video:

There are 98 new commits compared to 0.7, here's the most interesting changes:

- Terrain editor.
- Fixed Save/Save As dialog windows - now you don't have to type scene name in the path field,
  only in separate `File name` field.
- Sound editor - now it is possible do add and edit sound sources.
- Added Grid snapping for Move interaction mode.
- Fixed Move interaction mode - now it correctly handles complex hierarchies and multi-selection.
- Improved Settings window - now it has separate categories instead of huge list.
- Added continuous integration (huge thanks to [Voodlaz](https://github.com/Voodlaz))
- Added context menu for world outliner.
- Change main loop to prevent editor from spending too much time in logic update.
- Added ability to create quads.
- Save settings on every change.
- Tangent-space visualizer.
- Added ability to slowdown (Shift) or speedup (LeftCtrl) editor camera movement.
- Gizmos are full-bright and not affected by scene lights.
- Change selection to pasted nodes.
- Fixed uniform scaling.
- Fixed picking issues.
- Fixed "Fit Collider" issues.
- Now it is possible to change `znear` and `zfar` of preview camera.

- Added ability to edit collision groups and masks for colliders
- Minor fixes and improvements.
