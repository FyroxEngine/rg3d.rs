In November RG3D has gained a lot of new features and improvements.

- Migrated to nalgebra from custom linear algebra.
- Replaced custom physics engine with Rapier - now rg3d has powerful physics.
- Implemented sound backend for macOS (thanks [@toyboot4e](https://github.com/toyboot4e)) -
now macOS is fully supported OS.
- Environment mapping - now objects can have reflections (thanks [@itmuckel](https://github.com/itmuckel)).
- Implemented geometry instancing - now you can render tons of objects with
low overhead.
- Performance improvements
	- Optimized local transform calculations
	- Switched from slerp to nlerp for animations
	- Made a step to batched rendering - batches are generating, but for now they
	rendered either using instancing or one-by-one.
	- It is possible now to select shadow map precision (16bit or 32bit)
- Added [gobo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gobo_(lighting)) for spot lights 
(thanks [@itmuckel](https://github.com/itmuckel))
- Added CPU lightmapper - it is possible now to "bake" static lighting
into a texture to improve performance.
- Lots of other bugfixes and improvements.
