Fyrox is an [open-source](https://github.com/FyroxEngine/Fyrox) Rust game engine with lots of out-of-box 
game-ready features and a full-featured editor. Changes of this week was mostly focused on animation system
improvements.

## Blend Space

![blend space](/assets/twif15/blend_space.gif)

Blend space is an animation blending technique which allows you to blend multiple animations into one based
on two numeric input parameters (sampling point). Blend space consists of any number of points, located in
the value space; these points are triangulated:

To blend animation, you need to pass sampling point in (visualized as a crosshair on the screenshot) and 
the blend space will calculate weights for three animation poses around the sampling point. See the gif
above to get better understanding.

Where this technique is used? In pretty much any relatively complex modern game. It is used mainly to 
blend locomotion animations based on two parameters: speed and direction. For example, on the X axis you
can have direction angle and on Y axis - speed. Then you put desired animations on the blend space, and 
it will blend everything accordingly to speed and direction: if a character moves fast, then running 
animation will prevail, if it needs to run left - direction will be -1 and running left animation will
prevail and so on. It is a very powerful and flexible technique, that helps achieving naturally looking
animations on most conditions.

## Book Improvements

The book is slowly, but surely getting improvements. 7 sections were proofread and improved with more info.

## Other

It is now possible to show/hide debug shapes (for lights, cameras, etc.) in the editor. 

## Full List of Changes in Random Order

- Added blend space.
- Added blend space editor in the ABSM editor.
- Ability to enable/disable debug geometry in the editor.
- Various book improvements.
- Implement Reflect for RefCell<T> + Rc<RefCell<T>>
