Fyrox is a Rust game engine with lots of out-of-box game-ready features and a full-featured editor. Third week of 
December was mostly dedicated to polishing of the animation editors, however there's also a new functionality.

## Animation

Animation Blending State Machine editor is now fully functional and more or less production ready. Currently it is 
being battle-tested in [Station Iapetus](https://github.com/mrDIMAS/StationIapetus). On the screenshot above you can
see ~~spaghetti~~ animation graph for the upper body of the character. In action it looks like this:

Currently it is being hooked up to the game, so there's no in-game footage yet. It will be ready in next TWiF. On
this week the editor has some major bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements. On of such improvements is that 
"Play Animation" nodes now shows the name of the animation they're linked to.

Animation editor now is able to switch "loop" flag of the animation:

The editor (FyroxEd in general) now correctly leaves preview mode in all sub-editors before saving currently edited scene,
it is important because previously you could save the save in preview state and some undesired changes could end
up in the scene file.

## Other

State machine is now fully documented, animation is still on the list. The domain `fyrox.rs` was renewed for one 
year, kudos to [@jayrulez](https://github.com/jayrulez). 

## What's next?

Since animation system rework is almost done, all that is left to release v0.29 is to polish existing functionality. 
This includes bug fixing, ergonomics improvements, documenting undocumented, writing the book, etc. The release of 
0.29 should happen this year.

## Full List of Changes in Random Order

- Added a bunch of `find_by_name_ref/mut` methods to various animation entities containers.
- Show more info in absm nodes
- Fixed view desync in the absm editor (caused incorrect data representation when changing layers).
- Show handles of entities in the absm editor.
- Fixed incorrect documentation for `PerspectiveProjection::fov`
- Fixed selection issues when removing a state or a transition
- Fixed `PoseWeight` property editor (now it allows to select enum variant)
- Ability to retarget animation to an animation player directly (`Model::retarget_animations_to_player`).
- Direct access to animation events
- Ability to change looping of animations in the animation editor
- Ability to create layer masks from a hierarchy of nodes + ability to merge layer masks
- Made `InheritableVariable`'s method names much more clear.
- `Graph::try_get_of_type+try_get_mut_of_type` helper methods
- Removed redundant mutex in parameters container in state machines
- Leave preview mode in animation editors before saving current scene
- Removed optional key frames serialization mode
- Correctly remap handles of layer masks
- Added documentation for animation blending state machine entities
- Improved hash map serialization
