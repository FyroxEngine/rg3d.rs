Fyrox is an [open-source](https://github.com/FyroxEngine/Fyrox) Rust game engine with lots of out-of-box 
game-ready features and a full-featured editor. This week was mostly dedicated to adding Android support
and fixing annoying bugs.

## Basic Android Support

Android support was requested [multiple times](https://github.com/FyroxEngine/Fyrox/issues/175) already 
and after ~1.5 years from the first request it is finally added. It is not fully complete yet, because
a [separate sound backend](https://github.com/FyroxEngine/Fyrox/issues/435) should be added to 
`fyrox-template`, but it is already usable. Current renderer implementation is not great for mobile 
devices, because it uses graphics rendering techniques that are PC-oriented, so rendering performance is
quite bad if you use complex 3D graphics. However it is more or less fine on 2D graphics. There's a separate
[task](https://github.com/FyroxEngine/Fyrox/issues/434) about writing a separate, lightweight renderer for
mobile devices. Keep in mind, that you need to have a relatively new device (2015+), that supports 
OpenGL ES 3.0 to get the engine working on mobile devices.

## Lightmapper Fixes

As you might know, Fyrox has built-in lightmapper and it is integrated in the editor. For quite a long time,
there was a bug that corrupted GPU vertex buffers when preparing second UV map for light maps. Which resulted
in weird graphical artifacts. Also, when saving a scene with light map, node handles weren't correctly remapped
thus leading to panic when trying to load such scene. Now these bugs are fixed you can use lightmapper normally.

## HDR Fixes on OpenGL ES

For about a year, graphics looked pale on WebAssembly compared to PC. That's because of differences between
sRGB frame buffers behavior on OpenGL and OpenGL ES. sRGB frame buffers on OpenGL does not change input 
values from shader and write values as is (unless you turn sRGB conversion manually) and convert them to
linear when reading from sRGB textures. On OpenGL ES, however, such conversion is on by default in both 
ways and it led to pale-colored output image on platforms such as WebAssembly.

## Full List of Changes in Random Order

- Basic android support
- Correct window and OpenGL context initialization for all platforms
- `fyrox-template` improvements to generate Android executors
- Fixed incorrect sRGB conversion on WebAssembly and Android (OpenGL ES)
- Fixed multiple lightmapper issues and make it work correctly in the editor.
