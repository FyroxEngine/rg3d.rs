Fyrox is a modern game engine written in Rust, it helps
you to create 2D and 3D games with low effort using native editor; it is like Godot, but in Rust. This is the
biggest release of the engine since the very beginning. This release is mostly focused on animation,
editor, audio, quality-of-life improvements.</p> <h2 id="animation"><a href="#animation" class="header-anchor">#</a> Animation</h2> <p>Animation system was significantly improved, and now it should be much easier to create complex animations
that are used all over the place in the modern game development.</p> <h3 id="root-motion"><a href="#root-motion" class="header-anchor">#</a> Root Motion</h3> <p>Root motion is a special animation technique of motion transfer from a root bone to a physical capsule that
moves characters in games. It is used to prevent &quot;floating&quot; or &quot;sliding&quot; effect; to perfectly match capsule
motion with the motion from the animation. To get better understanding of how it works, check the video:</p> <div class="row"><div class="col col-12 text-center"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0lG8Spzk128" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div></div> <p>As you can see, root motion significantly improves overall animation quality: feet matches the ground and
the motion looks natural.</p> <h3 id="blend-space"><a href="#blend-space" class="header-anchor">#</a> Blend Space</h3> <p><img src="/assets/twif15/blend_space.gif" alt="blend space"></p> <p>Blend space is an animation blending technique which allows you to blend multiple animations into one based
on two numeric input parameters (sampling point). Blend space consists of any number of points, located in
the value space; these points are triangulated:</p> <p><img src="/assets/twif15/blend_space.png" alt="blend space 2"></p> <p>To blend animation, you need to pass sampling point in (visualized as a crosshair on the screenshot) and
the blend space will calculate weights for three animation poses around the sampling point. See the gif
above to get better understanding.</p> <p>Where this technique is used? In pretty much any relatively complex modern game. It is used mainly to
blend locomotion animations based on two parameters: speed and direction. For example, on the X axis you
can have direction angle and on Y axis - speed. Then you put desired animations on the blend space, and
it will blend everything accordingly to speed and direction: if a character moves fast, then running
animation will prevail, if it needs to run left - direction will be -1 and running left animation will
prevail and so on. It is a very powerful and flexible technique, that helps achieving naturally looking
animations on most conditions.</p> <h3 id="blend-shapes"><a href="#blend-shapes" class="header-anchor">#</a> Blend Shapes</h3> <div class="row"><div class="col col-12 text-center"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2VtYk2vDoTY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div></div> <p>Blend shapes allows you to dynamically change 3D meshes; they are widely used in games to create facial
animation, to dynamically add details to character body parts, etc. It is quite simple, yet very powerful
mechanism, that opens a wide range of possible uses: you can create cut-scenes directly on the engine where
your characters will speak using pre-defined set of shapes associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viseme" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">visemes<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>.
You can also use this to create characters creator for your game - all you need to do is to specify a set
of offsets for desired parts of face and then allow a player to mix these parts with any proportions they
like. In other words, actual use of this functionality is limited by your imagination.</p> <h3 id="ability-to-animate-material-properties"><a href="#ability-to-animate-material-properties" class="header-anchor">#</a> Ability to Animate Material Properties</h3> <p>It is now possible to animate properties of any material, it adds a lot of control for various visual
effects that use custom shaders. Animation editor is now able to bind to material properties, making
something like this possible:</p> <p><img src="/assets/twif12/material_animation.gif" alt="material animation"></p> <p>This can be applied to pretty much any numeric shader uniform, which adds an ability to create any kinds
of visual effects.</p> <h3 id="compound-rules-for-absm-transitions"><a href="#compound-rules-for-absm-transitions" class="header-anchor">#</a> Compound Rules For ABSM Transitions</h3> <p>In previous versions of the engine, transitions in animation blending state machines were driven directly
by a single <code>bool</code> property. In simple cases it was enough, however combining multiple variables was
problematic, because you need to introduce another variable for the result and use it in your ABSM. This
sometimes resulted in exponential growth of the amount of variables. In this release, the issue was solved
by introducing computational graph for logical expressions:</p> <p><img src="/assets/0.30/absm_conditions.png" alt="absm conditions"></p> <p>Now you can combine multiple logical values using standard logical operations such as AND, OR, NOT, XOR.
Previous functionality of fetching single bool parameter, was moved to <code>Parameter</code>.</p> <h3 id="animation-related-actions-for-enter-leave-state-events"><a href="#animation-related-actions-for-enter-leave-state-events" class="header-anchor">#</a> Animation-Related Actions for Enter/Leave State Events</h3> <p>It is now possible to rewind, enable, disable specific animations when entering/leaving ABSM state. It is
very useful if you have a one-shot animation (for example, for a melee attack) and you want it to play again
when some state was activated.</p> <p><img src="/assets/0.30/absm_actions.png" alt="absm actions"></p> <h3 id="other-animation-system-changes"><a href="#other-animation-system-changes" class="header-anchor">#</a> Other Animation System Changes</h3> <p>Animation blending state machine event <code>ActiveStateChanged</code> is now allows you to fetch previously active
state when a transition to another state was done.</p> <p>Previously, ABSM editor had a bug where activation of a state/transition on one layer was shown on the layer being
edited, causing confusion while debugging ABSMs.</p> <p>Animation blending performance was slightly improved by removing unnecessary calculation steps.</p> <h2 id="reflection-refactoring"><a href="#reflection-refactoring" class="header-anchor">#</a> Reflection Refactoring</h2> <p>Main downside of the previous version of reflection system in the engine is that it does not support reflection of types
with interior mutability. You simply cannot &quot;inspect&quot; fields of a of type with interior mutability
(such as <code>Mutex&lt;T&gt;</code>, <code>RwLock&lt;T&gt;</code>, <code>RefCell&lt;T&gt;</code>, <code>Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>, etc.), because anything that is located
inside these types require to hold some kind of lock while accessing the internals (<code>MutexGuard&lt;T&gt;</code> in case of
<code>Mutex</code>, <code>Ref&lt;T&gt;/RefMut&lt;T&gt;</code> in case of <code>RefCell</code> and so on).</p> <p>Interior mutability support in reflection system is crucial for animation system of the engine. Its main
usage is to animate numeric parameters of renderer materials. This ability allows you change shader uniforms
via standard animation pipeline.</p> <p>The API of <code>Reflect</code> trait was changed

Now, instead of returning references immediately, every function that previously returned references now has
additional parameter. This parameter is a reference to a closure that allows you to do something with a reference
to inner value. Such approach allows to hold mutex lock (and analogues) while doing something with the inner data.</p> <p>Another important reflection system improvement is hash map support. This functionality was added to have an
ability to animate properties of materials via engine's animation system. This was a pretty easy change, but it
added more flexibility to the reflection system.</p> <h2 id="android-support"><a href="#android-support" class="header-anchor">#</a> Android Support</h2> <p><img src="/assets/twif17/android.gif" alt="platformer on android"></p> <p>Android support was requested <a href="https://github.com/FyroxEngine/Fyrox/issues/175" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multiple times<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> already
and after ~1.5 years from the first request it is finally added. Current renderer implementation, however, is not
great for mobile devices, because it uses graphics rendering techniques that are PC-oriented, so rendering performance
is quite bad if you use complex 3D graphics. However it is more or less fine on 2D graphics. There's a separate

mobile devices. Keep in mind, that you need to have a relatively new device (2015+), that supports
OpenGL ES 3.0 to get the engine working on mobile devices.</p> <h2 id="headless-mode"><a href="#headless-mode" class="header-anchor">#</a> &quot;Headless&quot; Mode</h2> <p>Game servers usually do not render anything, nor playing any sounds. Even main application window can not exist.
Previously, it was somewhat impossible to fully prevent the engine from creating the window, render graphics and
output sounds. Now it is possible, to initialize the engine in &quot;headless&quot; mode without the window, renderer and
audio system initialized. It can be put back into standard mode at any time.</p> <h2 id="audio-system-refactoring"><a href="#audio-system-refactoring" class="header-anchor">#</a> Audio System Refactoring</h2> <p>Previously, the sound system supported direct output of sound samples to an audio playback device with some
effects that can take samples from sound sources and put processed samples in the audio playback device.
It worked ok for most cases, but it was quite rigid and effect management was a pain. To add more flexibility in
audio processing pipeline there was added two new entities: audio buses and audio bus graph.</p> <h3 id="audio-bus"><a href="#audio-bus" class="header-anchor">#</a> Audio Bus</h3> <p>Audio bus is a sound processing unit that takes samples from various sound sources, applies zero or more effects to
the samples and sends the samples either to an audio playback device or some other audio bus (see the next
section). Effect list includes: lowpass filter, highpass filter, bandpass filter, allpass filter, low and
high shelf filters, reverberation.</p> <h3 id="audio-bus-graph"><a href="#audio-bus-graph" class="header-anchor">#</a> Audio Bus Graph</h3> <p>Audio bus graph is a set of audio buses connected with each other: one audio bus could be a source of samples
for another audio bus or for an audio device:</p> <p><img src="/assets/twif13/data_flow_diagram.png" alt="data flow diagram"></p> <p>Such structure provides high flexibility, allowing you to create complex processing steps for the sound in your game.</p> <p>In action the graph looks (sounds) like this:</p> <div class="row"><div class="col col-12 text-center"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6-M3LUv9Jto" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div></div> <h3 id="other-audio-improvements"><a href="#other-audio-improvements" class="header-anchor">#</a> Other Audio Improvements</h3> <p>Sound panning in HRTF mode was fixed (left was right and vice versa).

crate as a sound output backend. This is a new, tiny crate that serves a single purpose - make audio output as simple
as possible. Also, compared to <code>cpal</code>, this crate it does not have weird sound artifacts on WebAssembly and builds fine
on Android platform.</p> <h2 id="scene-graph-improvements"><a href="#scene-graph-improvements" class="header-anchor">#</a> Scene Graph Improvements</h2> <p>Scene graph has some improvements as well.</p> <h3 id="ability-to-change-graph-root"><a href="#ability-to-change-graph-root" class="header-anchor">#</a> Ability to Change Graph Root</h3> <p>Sometimes there's a need to change scene graph root (for instance, to reorder the children nodes in a different
manner) and it was impossible to do in the previous version of the engine. This is now possible to do in the
current release. This could be done either from code by using <code>Graph::change_root/change_root_inplace</code> or
in the editor by right-clicking a node in the World Viewer and pressing <code>Make Root</code>.</p> <h3 id="navigation-mesh-node"><a href="#navigation-mesh-node" class="header-anchor">#</a> Navigation Mesh Node</h3> <p>Navigational meshes are now scene nodes and part of the scene graph. Previously, navmeshes were stored in a
separate storage which caused a lot of issues with property inheritance, scene integrity checks and many
other small issues.</p> <p>Navigation Mesh panel in the editor was made floating by default and it automatically appears when you
select the node.</p> <h3 id="improved-graph-search"><a href="#improved-graph-search" class="header-anchor">#</a> Improved Graph Search</h3> <p>It is now possible to do up-search in the <code>Graph</code>. It could be useful to find a parent entity of with a
particular component and get some data from it. Every graph search method is now returns a tuple
<code>Option&lt;Handle&lt;Node&gt;, &amp;Node&gt;</code> - as you can see they now also returns a reference to found nodes. This is
useful to prevent re-borrowing after you found a node.</p> <h2 id="message-passing-for-scripts"><a href="#message-passing-for-scripts" class="header-anchor">#</a> Message Passing for Scripts</h2> <p>Message passing is a mechanism that allows you send some data (message) to a node, hierarchy of nodes or
the entire graph. Each script can subscribe for a specific message type. It is efficient way
for decoupling scripts from each other. For instance, you may want to detect and respond to some event in
your game. In this case when the event has happened, you send a message of a type and every &quot;subscriber&quot;
will react to it. This way subscribers will not know anything about sender(s); they'll only use message
data to do some actions.</p> <h2 id="determinism-for-particle-systems"><a href="#determinism-for-particle-systems" class="header-anchor">#</a> Determinism for Particle Systems</h2> <p>Previously, particle systems used global pseudo-random numbers generator (PRNG), which resulted in non-deterministic
behavior. Now, each instance of particle system has its own PRNG and saves its seed, which makes behaviour of
particle systems deterministic. It is even possible to rewind particle systems to a particle time and the result
will always be the same (until PRNG implementation is not changed).</p> <h2 id="physics"><a href="#physics" class="header-anchor">#</a> Physics</h2> <p>Previously, any user force or torque applied a to rigid body (via respective methods) will remain the same
until you change it again, this behavior is now changed - the engine resets it to zero.</p> <p>Terrain height map colliders now takes node scaling into account.</p> <h2 id="rendering"><a href="#rendering" class="header-anchor">#</a> Rendering</h2> <p>Renderer was refactored to gather graphical data from scene nodes. Previously, the renderer gathered the data
by itself, but it was very restrictive and now it calls <code>Node::collect_render_data</code> for every node to generate
render batches. Also, frustum culling is now done on scene node side - the renderer only provides enough info
for clipping and you're free to implement it in any way you like. The refactoring is not fully done yet, some
parts of the renderer still manually collects render data from scene nodes of specific, hardcoded types. This
refactoring improves flexibility of the rendering.</p> <h3 id="bone-matrices"><a href="#bone-matrices" class="header-anchor">#</a> Bone Matrices</h3> <p>Previous versions of the engine had a limit of 64 bones per mesh surface, now it is pretty much unlimited (
standard shaders, however, still has 255 bones limit because it stores bones indices in a single byte).
Previous limit was forced by the limited amount of shader uniforms, the new limit, is only limited by a
data type used to store the numbers and the amount of VRAM.</p> <h3 id="offscreen-ui-rendering"><a href="#offscreen-ui-rendering" class="header-anchor">#</a> Offscreen UI Rendering</h3> <p>Offscreen UI rendering (rendering into texture) is now compatible with HDR pipeline, previously the textures
looked pale.</p> <h3 id="lightmapper-fixes"><a href="#lightmapper-fixes" class="header-anchor">#</a> Lightmapper Fixes</h3> <p><img src="/assets/twif17/lightmap.png" alt="ligthmap"></p> <p>As you might know, Fyrox has built-in lightmapper and it is integrated in the editor. For quite a long time,
there was a bug that corrupted GPU vertex buffers when preparing second UV map for light maps. Which resulted
in weird graphical artifacts. Also, when saving a scene with light map, node handles weren't correctly remapped
thus leading to panic when trying to load such scene. Now these bugs are fixed you can use lightmapper normally.</p> <h3 id="hdr-fixes-on-opengl-es"><a href="#hdr-fixes-on-opengl-es" class="header-anchor">#</a> HDR Fixes on OpenGL ES</h3> <p>For about a year, graphics looked pale on WebAssembly compared to PC. That's because of differences between
sRGB frame buffers behavior on OpenGL and OpenGL ES. sRGB frame buffers on OpenGL does not change input
values from shader and write values as is (unless you turn sRGB conversion manually) and convert them to
linear when reading from sRGB textures. On OpenGL ES, however, such conversion is on by default in both
ways and it led to pale-colored output image on platforms such as WebAssembly.</p> <h2 id="ui-improvements"><a href="#ui-improvements" class="header-anchor">#</a> UI Improvements</h2> <p>UI's <code>DrawingContext</code> is now able to draw arcs and rounded rectangles.</p> <h3 id="generic-vector-t-n-editor"><a href="#generic-vector-t-n-editor" class="header-anchor">#</a> Generic <code>Vector&lt;T,N&gt;</code> editor</h3> <p><code>fyrox-ui</code> now have generic version of <code>SVector&lt;T, N&gt;</code> editor. Also, this new editor supports limits (min, max),
and step that can be supplied to it using reflection (<code>min</code>, <code>max</code>, <code>step</code> attributes respectively). This can
be useful in your scripts: now your vector parameters can use these attributes.</p> <h3 id="numericupdown-widget"><a href="#numericupdown-widget" class="header-anchor">#</a> NumericUpDown Widget</h3> <p>Values of NumericUpDown widget can now be changed by mouse dragging:</p> <p><img src="/assets/twif16/spinner.gif" alt="spinner"></p> <h2 id="editor-improvements"><a href="#editor-improvements" class="header-anchor">#</a> Editor Improvements</h2> <p>FyroxEd is a native scene editor of the engine, it has lots of various improvements and new features

Previously, any sound in Playing
state would immediately start playing after you load a scene in the editor, making pretty much impossible
to create sound effects. It is now fixed, every sound is now not updating until you start previewing it.
This can be done in a new audio preview panel:</p> <p><img src="/assets/twif12/audio.png" alt="audio preview panel">.</p> <p>To activate it, all you need to do is to select a Sound node. Then you need to click on <code>Preview</code> checkbox
and the sound will start playing. Any changes made in this panel will not be recorded in the scene, you
can play with the sound as you want to.</p> <h3 id="color-gradient-editor"><a href="#color-gradient-editor" class="header-anchor">#</a> Color Gradient Editor</h3> <p>For a long time there was no property editor for <code>Color Over Lifetime</code> field of particle systems. The type of this
field is <code>ColorGradient</code> which allows you to define a set of color points and fetch intermediate values at any
position at the gradient. Now, the editor has property editor for <code>ColorGradient</code> and it works like so:</p> <div class="row"><div class="col col-12 text-center"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EkzDiCpvdhM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div></div> <h3 id="animation-editor"><a href="#animation-editor" class="header-anchor">#</a> Animation Editor</h3> <p><img src="/assets/twif14/anim_editor.png" alt="anim editor"></p> <p>The animation editor has many major quality-of-life improvements:</p> <ol><li>Ability to create special bindings to position/scaling/rotation properties of a scene nodes. Such bindings
are much faster in terms of performance and widely used in pretty much any animation.</li> <li>Ability to enable root motion and set its settings, like position and rotation filtering.</li> <li>Ability to reimport animation - this is useful when you need to replace an animation, but preserve its handle.
It is very useful if you already have an Animation Blending State Machine that uses an animation that you want
to change.</li></ol> <p>Imported animations are now enabled by default, previously they were imported as disabled which could lead
to confusions.</p> <p>Animation editor now validates all tracks of your animation, showing every track that has any issues, which may
include deleted scene node, changed property type, missing property binding. It it very useful for rapid
development - any issues are instantly highlighted helping you to fix it as fast as possible.</p> <h3 id="help-menu"><a href="#help-menu" class="header-anchor">#</a> Help Menu</h3> <p>It is now possible to open <a href="https://fyrox-book.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the book<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> and the <a href="https://docs.rs/fyrox/latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">API reference<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a>

preview in the asset list.</p> <p><img src="/assets/0.30/asset_preview.png" alt="asset preview"></p> <p>Sound resources will now automatically play (once per selection) when selected in the asset browser. This way
you can &quot;preview&quot; the sounds before using them.</p> <h3 id="editor-performance-improvements"><a href="#editor-performance-improvements" class="header-anchor">#</a> Editor Performance Improvements</h3> <p>There was a nasty performance degradation bug, that caused the editor to work more slowly over time, especially
when switching between multiple entities too frequently. The cause of bug was context menu system of the UI
framework. Context menus are &quot;standalone&quot; entities, they're not attached directly to a widget, instead widgets
just use their handles. Also, the same context menu can be shared across unlimited amount of other widgets.
Usually, when you deleting UI node, <code>fyrox-ui</code> deletes all children nodes, but since context menu is not a child
node, they weren't deleted, thus leading to tons of context menus left &quot;alive&quot;. Now this bug is fixed, by using
a special &quot;shared handle&quot;, which is essentially just a <code>Rc&lt;Handle&lt;UiNode&gt;&gt;</code>. It has a custom destructor that
sends a <code>WidgetMessage::Remove</code> message to the context menu when there's no more strong references to it.</p> <h3 id="recent-files"><a href="#recent-files" class="header-anchor">#</a> Recent Files</h3> <p>Recent files list in the editor now sorted and non-existing files are auto-removed from it:</p> <p><img src="/assets/twif13/recent.png" alt="recent files"></p> <h3 id="other-editor-changes"><a href="#other-editor-changes" class="header-anchor">#</a> Other Editor Changes</h3> <p>In the editor it is now possible to change the size of light pictograms - their default size could be too
big in specific cases.</p> <p><code>Lifetime</code> field is now visible again in the <code>Inspector</code>, previously it caused crashes and was temporarily
hidden. It is now possible to create temp nodes in the editor, that will be automatically deleted when the
lifetime reach zero.</p> <p>It is now possible to rewind particle systems during preview mode - it removes all generated particles
and starts generation over.</p> <p>Fixed a bug in the sound preview panel, it was possible to infinitely play a sound, even when preview mode is
disabled.</p> <p>It is now possible to show/hide debug shapes (for lights, cameras, etc.) in the editor.</p> <p>Editor's window position and size is now saved in settings file and restored on next load. It saves extra clicks
when opening/closing the editor in rapid development.</p> <h2 id="resource-management"><a href="#resource-management" class="header-anchor">#</a> Resource Management</h2> <p>Resource management was significantly improved in this release. It includes user-defined resource, resource
dependency graph and various bug fixes.</p> <h3 id="user-defined-resources"><a href="#user-defined-resources" class="header-anchor">#</a> User-Defined Resources</h3> <p>For a long time, Fyrox was able to manage only four hard-coded resource types (textures, models, shaders, curves)
and it was quite restrictive. Now you can create custom resource types. It could be useful to access specific data
using engine's resource manager. Custom resources has a few major advantages over manual resource management via
direct files access:</p> <ol><li>Since Fyrox resource system is asynchronous, your resource can be loaded in separate worker thread which speeds up
loading (since it may run on a separate CPU core).</li> <li>You can access your resources from the Asset Browser and assign their handles to scripts directly from the editor.</li> <li>File access for resource management has an abstraction, that unifies the access over all supported platforms. This
means that you don't need to use <code>fetch</code> API directly, if you're targeting WebAssembly platform, or use <code>AssetManager</code>
on Android.</li></ol> <p>For more info see the <a href="https://fyrox-book.github.io/resources/custom.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">respective chapter<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a> in the book.</p> <h3 id="resource-dependency-graph"><a href="#resource-dependency-graph" class="header-anchor">#</a> Resource Dependency Graph</h3> <p>Resource dependency graph allows you to collect all resources used by a resource. It could be useful when you
need to find unused resources, copy all dependent resources, etc. You can use this functionality in the editor
by right-clicking on a resource and then clicking <code>Dependencies</code>:</p> <p><img src="/assets/0.30/dependencies.png" alt="dependencies"></p> <h3 id="automatic-resource-handle-restoration"><a href="#automatic-resource-handle-restoration" class="header-anchor">#</a> Automatic Resource Handle Restoration</h3> <p>When the engine saves a scene that has resource handles, those handles saves only path to resources, not
the actual content. When loading the same scene, the engine re-loads all resources, but all handles scattered
around must be restored manually to point to actual resource data. This is now fixed, the engine will use
reflection to iterate over each field of every scene node and restore the handles.</p> <h3 id="other-resource-management-changes"><a href="#other-resource-management-changes" class="header-anchor">#</a> Other Resource Management Changes</h3> <p>It is now possible to fetch standard shader names. Sound nodes now have validation, which check if a sound source
has missing sound buffer.</p> <h2 id="property-inheritance"><a href="#property-inheritance" class="header-anchor">#</a> Property Inheritance</h2> <p>Property inheritance is used to propagate changes of unmodified properties from a prefab to its instances. For example,
you can change scale of a node in a prefab and its instances will have the same scale too, unless the scale is
set explicitly in an instance. Such feature allows you to tweak instances, add some unique details to them, but take
general properties from parent prefabs.</p> <p>In this release its reliability was significantly improved. This allowed to not serialize content of non-modified
properties (since their data is stored in parent prefab) which resulted in significant decrease of disk space usage
for derived prefabs.</p> <h2 id="terrain"><a href="#terrain" class="header-anchor">#</a> Terrain</h2> <p>Terrain node was changed significantly in this release. These changes will be a strong basis for further
improvements.</p> <h3 id="ability-to-change-height-map-and-mask-size"><a href="#ability-to-change-height-map-and-mask-size" class="header-anchor">#</a> Ability to Change Height Map and Mask Size</h3> <p>It is now possible to change height map and mask sizes. It could be useful if you created large terrain and want
to make it smaller and vice versa. Height maps or mask will be resampled to the new size, which could result in
data loss if you decreasing the size.</p> <h3 id="improved-chunking"><a href="#improved-chunking" class="header-anchor">#</a> Improved Chunking</h3> <p>Previously, it was impossible to add or remove terrain's chunks which was very limiting and it was basically
impossible to add a new editable portion to existing terrain. For example, if you made a terrain and decided
extend it from any side to add more content there - it was impossible, now, however, this issue is solved and
terrain could be extended from any side.</p> <h3 id="level-of-detail"><a href="#level-of-detail" class="header-anchor">#</a> Level-of-detail</h3> <p>Terrains now has powerful level-of-detail system implemented. It is now possible to create giant terrains (64x64km)
